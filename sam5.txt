Most people would agree that it is great to have a pet. They are our friends,
companions, family members. I have an adorable calico cat as a pet, her name
is Minnie. She is two years old, we adopted her when she was just a tiny kitten.
Calico is not a breed, it is a color pattern. A calico cat is usually white with
black and orange patches on the coat. Minnie is very curious and likes to walk
outdoors. We live on the ground floor, so she just jumps out of the window when
she wants to take a walk.
